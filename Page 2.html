    <hr>
    <h3><i>Mesopotamia is located in present day
        Iraq.
        <br>
         Mesopotamia is the land between two rivers.<br>
        The two rivers name call Tigris and Euphrates. <br>
        The first thing Sumerians did was get really good of farming. <br>
        Sumerians made weapons and they used them for hunting wild animals for foods. <br>
        And they discovered how to grow plants.<br>They also found out how to tame wild goats and sheep and raise for food that is call domestication.</i></h3>
