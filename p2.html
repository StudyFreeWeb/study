    <h3><i>It is easy to grow food in Mesopotamia because the soil here is so fertile and that is because of the mountains up north it snows a lot up there in the winter when the snow melts all that water runs down into the valley and into the rivers,<br>
        They grow barley and wheat and lots of beans and fresh vegetables and fruits like melons dates, apples, pigs and grapes.<br>
        Their animals give them milk, cheese and meat. <br>They invented a way to control the river. <br>
        First they learned how to build levees those are big piles of earth between the fields and the river they are too tall for the river to get over. </i></h3>
